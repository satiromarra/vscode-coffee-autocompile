## How to use [[&uarr;](#table-of-contents)]

### Settings [[&uarr;](#how-to-use-)]
[REQUIRED]

Open (or create) your `settings.json` in your `.vscode` subfolder of your workspace.

Add a `coffeescript.autocompile` section and one or more "watchers":

```json
{
    "coffeescript.autocompile": {
    }
}
```

| Name | Description |
| ---- | --------- |
| `bare` | `(true)` if output without the top-level function safety wrapper. Default: `(false)` |
| `header` | `(true)` if output the `Generated by CoffeeScript` header. Default: `(false)` |
| `inlineMap` | `(true)` if output the source map as a base64-encoded string in a comment at the bottom. Default: `(false)` |
| `isActive` | `(true)` if extension is active. Default: `(true)` |
| `sourceMap` | `(true)` to generate a source map. Default: `(true)` |
| `compress` | `(true)` to compress a javascript file. Default: `(false)` |
| `output` | `(string)` path of JS file to create. Default: `` |
| `options` | Additional [options](https://coffeescript.org/#nodejs-usage) for the compiler. |


### Settings in file [[&uarr;](#how-to-use-)]
---
[OPTIONAL]

Add the parameters on the first line (or the second line if the file contains a shebang) of the Coffee-script file.

* `out` (string)<sup><a id="ref-1" href="#note-1">1</a> <a id="ref-2" href="#note-2">2</a></sup>: path of JS file to create
* `bare` (bool): pass the `--bare` option to the Coffee-script compiler
* `compress` (bool): compress output JavaScript
* `sourcemap` (bool): create a sourcemap
  * The sourcemap file will be saved in {outputFilePath}.map

<sup><a id="note-1" href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> If the `compileIfNoOutSpecified` setting is enabled, this may be omitted. The file will then be saved in the same directory as the source file. If the file has the `.coffee` extension it will be removed, and the `.js` extension will always be appended.

<sup><a id="note-2" href="#ref-2">2</a></sup> The output filename may contain `$1` or `$2`, which will be replaced by the input basename and extension, respectively. So a file named `in.coffee` and is configured with `# out: $1.$2.js` will compile to `in.coffee.js`.
